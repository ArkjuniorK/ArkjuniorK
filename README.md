### Hello, I am ArkjuniorK ðŸ‘‹

I'm web developer based on Makassar, Indonesia. Currently work as freelance.

My stack is Go, Javascript/Typescript, PHP and Dart.

I'm currently working on my portfolio website.


####âš¡ Fun fact:
I actually moved from being a UI/UX Designer to Web Developer because of my curiosity about how to design a proper web that ease the devs building process.
It start with most basic thisngs such as HTML, CSS and JS. I should say that it really hard for me since there is no one in my family and environment that had any knowledge about tech.
Thus with some extra work and support from family and closest people I ended up choosing to change my focus to Web Developer.
