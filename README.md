**My stack is Go and Node.js**

#### âš¡ Fun fact:

I switched from being a UI/UX Designer to Web Developer because of my curiosity about how to design a proper web that ease the devs building process.
It start with most basic thisngs such as HTML, CSS and JS. I should say that it really hard for me since there is no one around that had any knowledge about building sysetem.
Thus with some extra work and support from families and closest people I'm successfully manage to learn and finally made a simple app.
